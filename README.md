# severed-steel-vr
Severed Steel VR mod & VR plugin example.

Does not compile on its own. SDK needs to be dumped separately and placed in the project, and may need manual fixes.

## Install

First, make sure that you are using the very latest **NIGHTLY** version of UEVR, which you can [download here](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR-nightly/releases/latest/) or by using  [Rai Pal](https://github.com/Raicuparta/rai-pal)

Get the [latest release zip](https://github.com/praydog/severed-steel-vr/releases/latest) and click "Import Config" in UEVR, browse to the zip and click it.

## Troubleshooting
This plugin will not work on an incorrect version of UEVR.

If you have any previous UEVR profile for this game, you may need to delete it as it may conflict with what this is attempting to do.
